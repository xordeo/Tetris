Tetris game rules:

Random tetramino pieces fall from above into a rectangular glass 10 squares wide and 20 squares high.

In flight, the player can rotate a piece by 90° and move it horizontally.

It is also possible to "drop" the figurine, i.e. accelerate its fall, 
when it's already decided where it's going to fall.

If the player wants to save a particular piece, it can be taken in the field HOLD, 
and after the next piece has been placed, 
he can swap the current piece with the piece in the HOLD field.

The piece falls until it hits another piece or the bottom of the cup.

If a horizontal row of 10 squares is filled, it disappears and everything above it falls to the bottom of the glass, 
above it falls down by one cell.

In addition, the NEXT field shows five figures that will follow 
after the current one - this is a hint that allows the player to plan actions.

The pace of the game speeds up every half a minute.

The game ends when a new figurine cannot fit into the cup.

The player receives points for each completed row.
1 row - 100
2 rows - 300
3 rows - 700
4 rows - 1500
